# Etch-a-Sketch

A personal project that is inspired by the old-school mechanical drawing board, the Etch A Sketch.

The application allows the user to draw on the grid by clicking or holding the left mouse button. 
A menu on the left features several functions that enable the user to:
 - Change color
 - Toggle the randomized/rainbow color mode
 - Use the eraser function
 - Reset the grid
 - Adjust the gird size
